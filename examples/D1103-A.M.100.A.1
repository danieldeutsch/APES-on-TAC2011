The trial opened Thursday of 29 suspects charged with involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks, which killed 191 people in one of Europe's worst terror strikes. 

The prosecution alleges that the March 11 attacks, which left more than 1,800 injured, were the work of mainly Moroccan Islamic extremists inspired by Al- Qaeda and angered by Spanish military participation in Iraq.
